# `cabinetry` at the `pyhf` Users and Developers Workshop 2023

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/alexander-held/pyhf-workshop-2023-cabinetry/HEAD?labpath=talk.ipynb)

*Contribution to [pyhf Users and Developers Workshop 2023](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1294577/), based on a [contribution to the Belle II pyhf workshop](https://indico.belle2.org/event/8470/)*

The `cabinetry` library provides interfaces and functionality for both the creation and use of statistical models together with `pyhf`. Models can be built from instructions provided in a declarative configuration. A high-level inference API and visualization utilities help study and disseminate fit results.

This talk will provide an overview of `cabinetry` and also highlight recent additions and ongoing developments.

## How to run
